# AutoMapper

[AutoMapper](https://docs.automapper.org/en/stable/index.html) is a package used to map data from one object to another.

AutoMapper uses a convention-based matching algorithm to match up source to destination values. It's geared towards model projection scenarios to flatten complex object models to DTOs and other simple objects, whose design is better suited for serialization, communication, messaging, or simply an anti-corruption layer between the domain and application layer.
