# Worker Services

This project shows an example of using Worker/Background services provided by ASP.NET Core. These can be used for more simple tasks that need to run continuously in the background and setting up [Hangfire](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire) or [Quartz.NET](https://github.com/quartznet/quartznet) would be overkill.

Detailed documentation can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/hosted-services?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio).

Examples with the project:

* Multiple Background Worker services
* Dependency Injection setup
