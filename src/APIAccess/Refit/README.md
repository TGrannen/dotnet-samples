# Refit

This project is designed to expirement with the [Refit](https://github.com/reactiveui/refit) NuGet package for autogenerating .Net API client code. This project has a Refit interface configured to communicate with the very simple [https://yesno.wtf](https://yesno.wtf) API as a proof of concept.

This can be expanded upon in the future with more detailed examples.
