# Flurl

This project is designed to experiment with the [Flurl.Http](https://flurl.dev/) NuGet package for making Http requests
easy. This project is configured to communicate with the very
simple [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API as a proof of concept.

This can be expanded upon in the future with more detailed examples.
