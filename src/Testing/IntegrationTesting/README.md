# Integration Testing

Integration tests ensure that an app's components function correctly at a level that includes the app's supporting
infrastructure, such as the database, file system, and network. These projects showcase how to set up integration test
projects with [NUnit](https://docs.nunit.org/) and [xUnit](https://xunit.net/) with a Postgres Database running in a
container during test execution.
