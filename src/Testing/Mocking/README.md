# Automated Test Mocking

This project allows the comparison of popular `Mocking` packages [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq4), [NSubstitute](https://github.com/nsubstitute/NSubstitute), and [FakeItEasy](https://fakeiteasy.github.io/). It also includes examples of the following:

* [Shouldly](https://docs.shouldly.org/) is an assertion framework which focuses on giving great error messages when the assertion fails while being simple and terse.
* [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) integration testing with Dependency Injection and Logging verification
