# API Docs

ASP.NET Core supports the generation of [OpenAPI documents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/openapi/overview?view=aspnetcore-9.0) in controller-based and
minimal APIs apps. The OpenAPI specification is a programming language-agnostic standard for
documenting HTTP APIs. This standard is supported in ASP.NET Core apps through a combination of built-in APIs and open-source libraries.

## [Scalar](https://scalar.com/)

The [Scalar.AspNetCore](https://github.com/scalar/scalar/blob/main/documentation/integrations/dotnet.md) package provides a simple way to integrate the Scalar API reference into
your .NET 8+ application.
