# Dotnet Samples

This repository's purpose is to showcase common design patterns, best practices, and popular NuGet packages that I've found to be helpful during .Net development. I use this repository for quick reference for how to use particular packages or how I solved a particular solution in the past at a high level. This way I don't have to spend time scouring the web to find the right example for what I'm trying to do.
