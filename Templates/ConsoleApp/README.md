# Command based Console App

This project showcases the [McMaster.Extensions.CommandLineUtils](https://github.com/natemcmaster/CommandLineUtils) NuGet package for easily creating expansive command line user interfaces with automatic parameter reading and help menu generation.

To view this demo, build the project and invoke the CLI help menu with `.\ConsoleApp.exe -h` to see the available commands.
