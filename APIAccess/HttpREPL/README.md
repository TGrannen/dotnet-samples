# Http REPL

This project is just a simple Web API that can be used to play around with the [Http REPL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/http-repl) tool. There is nothing special about this project to use the tool, but this is just a simple stand alone project that can be used for experimentation.

Follow the instruction [Here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/httprepl-a-command-line-tool-for-interacting-with-restful-http-services/) to install HttpRepl via the dotnet CLI and set it up to work in Visual Studio.
