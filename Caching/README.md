# Caching

Caching is the process of storing the data thatâ€™s frequently used so that data can be served faster for any future requests. ASP.NET provides both implementation and abstractions for local memory and distrubuted caches. This project showcases both caching styles.

See the [Caching Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/memory?view=aspnetcore-6.0) for more information.
