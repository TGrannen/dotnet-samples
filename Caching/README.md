# Caching

Caching is the process of storing the data thatâ€™s frequently used so that data can be served faster for any future requests. ASP.NET provides both implementation and abstractions
for local memory and distributed caches. This project showcases both caching styles with the usage of FusionCache. See
the [.NET Caching Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/overview) for more information.
